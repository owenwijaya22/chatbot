# AI Chatbot

## Description
The chatbot is designed with prompt engineering to provide a highly interactive and responsive user experience with lifted content restrictions.

## Technical Specifications
The chatbot application is powered by an Ubuntu server with the following configurations:
- RAM: 4GB
- vCPU: 2

## DNS Configuration
The application is accessible via a custom domain, set up with the DNS services provided by Name.com and Namecheap.com. I've used A records for IP address mapping, and NS records to specify the authoritative nameservers for the domain.

## Security and Environment Variables
Security is a paramount concern for me. For this reason, I use environment variables for all sensitive data. These variables are hashed using the `385147a` algorithm, helping protect all confidential information.

## Deployment and Access
The chatbot application is deployed and maintained on the cloud computing platform, DigitalOcean. You can access the chatbot at [**Main Link**](https://mitsuki.software/chat) and [**Alternative Link 2**](https://orca-app-fiqsz.ondigitalocean.app/chat). Please use the POST request method to test the application.

## Support
If you encounter any issues or have any questions related to the application, please feel free to raise an issue on this repository. I'll do my best to provide a prompt response to your queries.
